no pruning

python main.py \
    --k 16 \
    --pruning_layer 5 \
    --output_epsilon 0.1 \
    --eps 0.00 \
    --gpu 0 

pruning

python main.py \
    --k 10 \                         #just change k to some value < 16 
    --pruning_layer 3 \              #not quite sure how this changes things, just where pruning is pplied
    --output_epsilon 0.1 \           #just value with which we want the output to be bound below (doesn't really do much)
    --eps 1.0 \                      #i wish this did something, not sure the issue, probably my subtract function in zonotope.py
    --gpu 0 

notes: 

- output shows the maximum possible absolute difference between the output logits of the unpruned model and the pruned model
- k represents number of tokens kept
- changes in pruning layer and k are reflected in the output as expected
- eps doesn't seem to have any effect which is wrong 
- baseline shows that when no pruning is done, output is 0 (this is correct)
- can set --p value, but without defaults to 2
