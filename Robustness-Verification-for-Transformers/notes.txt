subtract every element in input by max to normalize magnitude.

clamp?

upstream issue. 

softmax print max and min value

print data related to input values related to softmax

print relevant values and see where it happens, diagnostic problem, dump statistics

dump t_opt could be too small or too large which can lead to overflow
